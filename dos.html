      <h1>Stay hydrated</h1>

      <h1>Manage your stress</h1>
      <p>Stress can trigger hormonal changes that can somehow contributes your skin of having multiple acne breakouts. So, it is a good thing that you should manage your stess or maybe at least practice it and here are some common methods. First one is called "DOING YOGA". Doing yoga can keep your body fit, strong, healthy, flexible, have a maintain balence and it can also help your skin to become healthy and it can also make your face become more slimmer. Not only yoga, you should also do some breathing exercises because breathing exercises can make you feel relive whenever you are having or facing some difficulities and it can also improve your concertration.Or you can just somehow draw a scedule of how you want to manage it.  </p>

      <h1>Use tropical treatments</h1>
      <p>We would highly recommand you to use some tropical medication if your acne/pimple is getting too big that it can be harm or dangerous since these kind of treatments can somehow cure your skin and protect it from the harm but keep in mind that not all of use's kins are suitable for this kind of treatments since let's just say your skin is sort of sensitive then at this rate these kinds of treatments might not be for you but if you are looking forwards to do this kind of treatment then look for over-the-counter ones that are containing ingredients like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or alpha hydroxy acids. These can help to unclog pores and reduce inflammation more.</p>

      <h1>Keep your face clean</h1>
      <p>Wash your face gently twice a day using a mild, non-comedogenic cleanser. Avoid over-cleansing, as this can strip your skin of natural oils and worsen acne. You should also avoid touching your face since whether if you wash your hands or if you don't, your hands still might have some bacterias that can cause pimples and acnes on your face.I would also recommand you to use the most suitable products for your skin so that it can somehow prevent some acnes and you may also need to have a healthy skincare routine which I will be mentioning and talking about that more in the next section.</p>

      <h1>Maintain a healthy diet</h1>
      <p>If you want your face to become really clear, moisturize and healthy, we would recommand you to have a healthy diet which means you might have to stop eating a LOT of sweet stuff since sweets can grow little amounts of pimples on your face. A healthy diet should have a rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Some of the studies suggest us that certain foods, like dairy and high-glycemic-index foods, might exacerbate acne in some individuals just like sweets. </p>

    <div class="yellow">
      <h1>Spot treatment</h1>
      <p>Apply spot treatments or get some treatments if needed since for most of the people who have pimples or acnes for a long time, just getting skincare products isn't enough, at this rate it would be better if you apply to some nearby clinics so that the doctors can help you. We would kindly recommand Doctor Wai's clinic since it has some really good reviews and the customer service's are nice. </p>
